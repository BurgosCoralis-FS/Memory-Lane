![Cora's Diary](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/676655695877111858/1220106841980141708/diary_logo.png?ex=660dbc0b&is=65fb470b&hm=e1afbf303441a5823ff885117ead8f2baf3544730e9f13fa0ec54ab93dd6e5d3&)

Since summer of last year, I've been learning Korean. For the past few months, my teacher has assigned me to write diary entries in Korean as homework. 

For the first few months, I had downloaded an app on my phone to be able to write the entries until iOS came out with an update that brought their own journal app.

My teacher is currently in a month long trip with her family and during last week's CRUD assignment, I had the idea of making my own [journal website](https://cora-korean-journal-99333a1293d2.herokuapp.com/) applying what I've learned so far in this class. That way, I can combine practicing a language and my programming skills in one go. 

As of now, I'm mainly focusing on the backend and making sure everything is working as intended before I continue to style the site completely how I envision it. 

I'm using Heroku, React and MongoDB and also working with Ant Design components in hopes that it can add a little extra to the styling :)
