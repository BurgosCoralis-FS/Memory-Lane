![Swagger's How To Build an API From The Ground Up](https://static1.smartbear.co/swagger/media/blog/wp-hub/inspect-image.png)

> Step 1: Design the API
---
The first step in designing your API is having clarity in what you want your API to do and how it will benefit its users and organizations. Afterwards, decide the required sources, how the data will be formatted and structured and defining the endpoints.

> Step 2: Implementing the API
---
APIs can be built using a variety of protocols, programming languages and architectures. Choosing the appropriate protocol depends on factors like scalability, performance, and the nature of the data being exchanged. REST is the most popular API architecture but there are other options such as Webhooks, GraphQL and SOAP. Additionally, APIs can be written in almost any programming language but NodeJs, Python, Java and Ruby are the most common and popular. 

> Step 3: Test the API
---
During tests, it's important to validate the API's behavior and functionality in diverse ways. For example:
- Is the API connecting to the server and endpoints correctly?
- Can you successfully send a POST request?
- Can associations between the models be created?


> Step 4: Create documentation
---
Creating a comprehensive documentation that outlines the API's functionality, endpoints, requests/response formats and such will ensure that developers utilize the API correctly and facilitates the integration time and errors that could come with it.
