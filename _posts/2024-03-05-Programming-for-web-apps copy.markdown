Week 1: Creating your Backend API
---
This week, felt like we were going through a refresher on how to create a Backend API therefore, we created an endpoint where it would accept 4 POST fields that contained an email, phone number, birthday, and password. 

Week 2: Making your API Modular
---
I learned a lot about RegEx and learned how to create NodeJs modules. For this week, we had to create a custome NodeJs/NPM package that contained validation middleware for the previously created POST endpoint. Once, that package was created, we also had to incorporate it into the previous week's project.

Week 3: Writing Tests for your API
---
We learned about Jest and how to utilize it. Then, we had to create a NPM package that included 7 tests:  
\- Test 1: Confirm that the API is up and running.  
\- Test 2: Send a POST request to the endpoint and verify that it doesn't respond with a 404 status code.    
\- Test 3: Send a complete valid POST request to the endpoint and make sure that it responds with a 2xx status code.  
\- Test 4: Send an invalid email to the endpoint and make sure that it responds with a 422 response code.  
\- Test 5: Send an invalid phone number to the endpoint and make sure that it responds with a 422 response code.  
\- Test 6: Send an invalid birthday to the endpoint and make sure that it responds with a 422 response code.  
\- Test 7: Send an invalid password to the endpoint and make sure that it responds with a 422 response code.  

Once the package was created, we had to install it into the project created in week 1.

Week 4: Documenting your API
---
Learned about Swagger to document our API's as well learned about the importance of documenting a project. This week we just had to create a NPM package that contained our Swagger documentation and install it into week 1's project.

In conclusion
---
I found this course to be extremely easy but still got to learn and practice new things. Previously, because the course assignments would take me a lot of time to finish, I wasn't able to do other things even with a schedule created but, during this month, I found myself to have a lot of free time and was able to catch up with things I had previously neglected.
