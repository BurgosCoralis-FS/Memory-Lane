Week 1: Web Discovery 
---
Discussed the origins of the web, current MVC implementations, team roles and dream careers, and how different web languages combine to create a web application or a browser window. 

As for the exercises during this week, we got to fix the css and html of a webstite, discussed our dream careers and got to make a video where we introduced ourselves, used wappalyzer on the website of a dream company we wanted to work with and identify 3 languages that will be useful for us in our field.

Week 2: Delivering Content To a Browser
---
Focused on the importance of understanding and writting proper HTML code, identifying specific parameters with unique tags and learned about their purpose in a browser-based application, and debugged a live HTML code on the browser either using a text editor or the inspector tool. 

Week 3: Customizing The Look & Feel
---
Here we started working with CSS. We got to learn and understand the basics of it, recognize CSS rules and its syntax, we got do debug live CSS via the inspector tool, and editing and writing our own CSS rules to style an existing HTML.

Week 4: The Sum Of It All
---
We put everything we had learned throughout the month together and created custom HTML and CSS code that respected industry standards, debugged live code with the inspector tool once again, and explored career opportunities and researched for their required skillsets.

In conclusion

If I remember correctly, this is the first class once you get admitted into the Web Development program. Back then I knew basically nothing. I had worked previously a bit with WordPress but had no experience writing code from scratch.  
Looking back at these previous projects, I know get to see how much I've learned and how I have sharpened my skills. The CSS in those projects were... quite rough, to say it nicely.

It also reminded me how I was dead set on wanting to become a Front End Developer because, at the time, it was what I found to be easiest and now, it has changed to wanting to become a Full Stack Developer as I find it equally fun to develop the front end and back end of a project.
