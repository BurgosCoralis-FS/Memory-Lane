Week 1: Docker
---
It was basically installing and getting familiarized with Docker. I encountered a lot of problems during installation because of terminal and working with neovim for the first time.

Week 2: Hypertext Transport Protocol
---
Where we learned about HTTP requests and responses and utilizing RESTful routes with ExpressJS. HTTP requests was covered in previous classes but this time around I got to learn more about the responses as I had only worked with 200 and 500. 

Thankfully, during this week I ran into no problems.

Week 3: Database Abstraction Layering
---
Learned about the theory of data. Worked with MySQL and practiced database abstraction utilizing the ORM abstraction pattern, in this case, we worked with SequelizeORM. We Learned how to generate models, migrations and seeders. During this week, we also started working with what would be the final project, a space tracker API.

Here I ran into a lot of problems with Docker and using MySQL inside a container. It took multiple days of looking for answers online and as of right now, I can't remember how I got it working but it was a huge weight off my shoulders. 

Week 4: Template Engines
---
We focused on the view layer of an MVC application and created a RESTful HTML application by integrating template engines into the project. 

This was the week where I had the most fun and in the end, I'm really proud of the final product of my project :) Here's a link to the video I submitted: [Space Tracker UI](https://youtu.be/InZzFaYk2yo)

In conclusion

This course was quite challenging for me but I was able to learn a lot from my mistakes and dive even further into topics that were briefly discussed in a prior course.
